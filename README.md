And the most important point for this idea is Everything will be going to be digitize in coming era so, the banking system will also join this part by making Security stronger and Banking Easier for Everyone.Everyone wants keep their hard earned money in safe and secure place so, they can use it in emergency situation. For this all choose to save their money in bank because everyone trusts on bank. For Making this trust stronger we develop this project.

Necessity:-The First reason is COVID pandemic, in this pandemic we want to follow non-contact Criteria which helps us to make contact with panel which is frequently used by others people.Other reason is everything will be going to be digitize in coming era so, the banking system will also join this part by making Security stronger and Banking Easier for Everyone.The Contactless solution for banking detects, interacts and responds to customers, who can create new accounts, make purchases and securely carry out any transaction at any time of the day.Contactless banking especially caters to the needs of customers who are hard-pressed for time, impeding their access to the bank during the bank's normal work hours.

TOOLS USED TO DESIGN AND DEVELOP FACE RECOGNITION:
• Flask: Flask is a web framework, it's a Python module that
lets us develop web applications.
• OpenCV: It is an open source library which is very useful
for computer vision applications
• Face_recognition: The library is used to recognize and manipulate faces
from python or from the command line.
• Numpy: it is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.

TOOLS USED TO DESIGN AND DEVELOP SPEECH SYNTHESIS:
• ResponsiveVoice Text To Speech API : Use for speech recognition (i.e., speech to text)

TOOLS USED TO DESIGN AND DEVELOP FRONTEND WEB:
• HTML: Hypertext Markup Language is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.
• CSS: color formatting and alignment
• Java script: for handling speech recognition & synthesis
• Bootstrap: It is used for responsiveness (optimising with screen size)

IMPLEMENTATION OF FACE RECOGNITION IN CONTACTLESS BANKING SYSTEM:-
• Recognise the face of account holder and display name.
• If recognised, website will lead to next page for transaction activities.
• If not recognised, process will not move ahead.

IMPLEMENTATION OF SPEECH RECOGNITION IN CONTACTLESS BANKING SYSTEM: -
used to give command to notify no. of amount

IMPLEMENTATION OF FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT IN CONTACTLESS BANKING SYSTEM:-
• The structure of web page has been created using HTML.
• The CSS make the webpage more interactive and appealing.
• Bootstrap Tools: our model can be responsive as per variable kiosk screen sizes.
